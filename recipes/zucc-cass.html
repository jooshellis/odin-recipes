		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Roasted zucchini with onion and layered with marinara sauce and pasta. A meal-in-one with a salad and rolls. Can't get better than that! A great way to use up your zucchini crop in the summer.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3 medium zucchinis, sliced</li>
			<li>2 medium onions, sliced</li>
			<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
			<li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 (16oz) package penne pasta</li>
			<li>1 (28oz) jar marinara sauce</li>
			<li>1/2 cup grate parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Toss zucchinis and onions in a large bowl with olive oil until evenly coated. Spread vegetables into a large baking dish.</li>
			<li>Roast vegetables in the preheated oven until golden, about 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
			<li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
			<li>Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
			<li>Heat marinara sauce in a saucepan over medium heat until sauce is hot. Spread hot marinara sauce into the prepared baking dish, followed by penne pasta and zucchini mixture. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese atop vegetables.
			<li>Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly, 35 to 40 minutes. Allow casserole to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
